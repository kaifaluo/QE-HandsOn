     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00000366    0.00000000    0.00000000
     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00000366    0.00000000    0.00000000

     Total force =     0.000005     Total SCF correction =     0.000103
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

     bfgs converged in  12 scf cycles and  11 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-08 Ry, force <  1.0E-05 Ry/Bohr)
